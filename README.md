# CYBERATTACKS-ON-TEENAGERS

## Abstract
The increasing use of technology and social media by teenagers has made them more vulnerable to cyberattacks, including identity theft, phishing, hacking, and cyberbullying. This project aims to identify the various types of cyberattacks that teenagers are vulnerable to and predict their outcomes using machine learning techniques. The study's significance stems from its potential to provide insights into the patterns and trends of cyberattacks against minors and develop effective strategies for prevention and mitigation.

## Objectives
1. Increase awareness about the potential dangers associated with technology and social media usage among teenagers.
2. Educate teenagers on the necessary knowledge and skills to defend themselves against cyberattacks.
3. Develop and implement effective prevention strategies to reduce the incidence of cyberattacks on teenagers.
4. Provide support and resources to teenagers who have been affected by cyberattacks.

## Implementation
- Data Preparation: Cleaning the dataset, removing unwanted columns, and handling null values.
- Data Exploration: Analyzing the dataset using various NumPy and Pandas functions.
- Data Visualization: Exploring the dataset through graphs and visualizations.
- Encoding Categorical Data: Performing label encoding on categorical variables.
- Splitting the Dataset: Dividing the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
- Testing: Implementing and evaluating various classification algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest classifier, decision tree classifier, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors.

## Experimental Results
Among the tested classification models, the random forest classifier and decision tree classifier achieved the best accuracy. The random forest classifier was chosen as the optimal model due to its superior runtime efficiency and accuracy.

## Future Work
- Develop innovative technologies and tools, such as AI-based threat detection systems and advanced password encryption techniques.
- Implement comprehensive educational programs and awareness campaigns in collaboration with policymakers, educators, and parents.
- Conduct longitudinal research to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of preventive strategies and educational initiatives.

## Conclusion
This research contributes to our understanding of cybercrime awareness among teenagers and highlights the need for innovative solutions and comprehensive educational programs to enhance their online safety. The comparative analysis of various classification algorithms identified the random forest classifier as the most suitable choice for predicting the type of cybercrime based on input data.
